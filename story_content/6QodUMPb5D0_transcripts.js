"},{"start":6223,"text":"We've known for about 100 years that the brain has electricity. This is not new information."},{"start":11898,"text":"And typically, when we want to measure what's going on in the brain for the last 70 or so years, we've had to go to a hospital and typically a psychiatric hospital."},{"start":21259,"text":"And you sit down behind a chair, you have a big helmet and about 50 wires coming out of your head."},{"start":26539,"text":"And that's how we can measure the electricity in your brain. "},{"start":29366,"text":"But it wasn't very helpful because it was a person that was just sitting down, not really doing anything, limited by the constraints of that big helmet."},{"start":37829,"text":"Well, in the last 5 to 7 years alone, so this is very new, technology has completely changed that."},{"start":43948,"text":"We have Bluetooth technology that conveniently fits on someone's head now."},{"start":48426,"text":"And I can look into someone while they're shooting a basketball, while they're trying to solve a problem, while they're thinking any thought, maybe they're having a conversation, listening to something on their phone. "},{"start":57467,"text":"And I can measure what's going on."},{"start":59553,"text":"And what we have found out that in the brain there is quantity of brain waves."},{"start":64012,"text":"So the volume of the thoughts that are going on in your brain as well as the intensity which is measured in Hertz, five, ten, 15, 20 hertz. "},{"start":72891,"text":"And when the quantity and the intensity go up, the temperature, the actual heat temperature in the brain goes up, the brain is 70% fluid and it sits in a skull. "},{"start":85248,"text":"So when those thoughts go up, the number of thoughts go up and the intensity goes up it generates heat, just like electricity, like a light bulb."},{"start":92603,"text":"But there's no place for that heat to go because it's captured in a skull."},{"start":97035,"text":"And the universal color that we have for heat all over the world, like a radar map or a stove in a kitchen, is that red means heat."},{"start":106299,"text":"Blue means cold ice. And then so there's a spectrum between red, you go to yellow, you go to green, and all the way down to blue."},{"start":113771,"text":"So these are universal colors."},{"start":115584,"text":"And it was a pure coincidence that I was while I was looking at the brain and I noticed, oh, my gosh, this person has a lot of negative thoughts and they're processing something with a lot of consequences."},{"start":126645,"text":"The scan began to turn red, and so that's how we came up with the nomenclature of red, green, yellow."},{"start":135045,"text":"Red being that the electricity, the quantity, the intensity in your brain is extremely high."},{"start":140933,"text":" Yellow means it's average. Yellow is not good, it's not bad."},{"start":144395,"text":"And green is when there's not a lot of electricity in the quantities low and the intensity is low."},{"start":150871,"text":"When the quantity and the intensity of the brainwaves are low, that's when our brain functionality peaks."},{"start":158691,"text":"We can think of ideas. We can remember an article that we read, a video that we saw, a conversation that we had, a past project, a past success story."},{"start":166660,"text":"Our empathy goes up because we can pay attention to other people, and the stimuli of seeing things is does not have any interference."},{"start":176240,"text":"I notice things. So all of my senses are wildly awake because there's no traffic for the senses to talk to my brain, to associate them with my positive memories, which is resilience or something negative that also happened to me, which is empathy."},{"start":190684,"text":"So that I can then demonstrate that. "},{"start":192912,"text":"So this is how we came up with the red, green, yellow."},{"start":195169,"text":"It was not a random, you know, just let's make it look like a traffic light."},{"start":199515,"text":"It really is the state of the brain."},{"start":201611,"text":"And the last thing that I want to share with you is that I have found that when people can label their cognitive and emotional state, how they're thinking, how they're feeling simply in those three colors red, green, yellow."},{"start":215328,"text":"It then replaces a vast majority of old traditional labels like Mad, Happy, Sad, Glad, Annoyed, which have so much a judgment associated with them."},{"start":227051,"text":"And two people could say that they're mad, but and they could mean the same thing, or they could mean something completely different."},{"start":232864,"text":"So red, green, yellow is not only a more accurate depiction of what's going on in your brain, but it also is a judgment free."},{"start":240700,"text":"It's very easy to say, Oh, I'm red."},{"start":243499,"text":"That means my brain is operating at about 5%."},{"start":246896,"text":"Okay, well, that's not good."},{"start":248272,"text":"That means my best stuff, my memories, my experiences, my skills, my training is not going to come out well."},{"start":253925,"text":"Well, what can I do, then, to get back to green?"}]}]};
